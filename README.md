This app – [DEPLOYED HERE](https://n-ckr-ch-rds-n.github.io/mantra-generator/) – allows users to generate mantras for their spells using a technique from traditional chaos magick.
A user can enter an intention (e.g. "to become a living god"). The generator then strips out all duplicated letters, displays the resulting letters on a series of tiles and allows the user to keep shuffling the tiles until the order of the letters forms a satisfactory mantra.

As well as providing a useful tool to budding sorcerers, the creation of the Mantra Generator also allowed me to try out a new animation technique :slightly_smiling_face:.

Mantra Generator is built with Angular. If you want to run it locally, clone the repo, `npm install` and `npm run start`.
